		Journey through Europe is a family board game published by Ravensburger. The board is a map of Europe with various major cities marked, for example, Athens, Amsterdam and London. The players are given a home city from which they will begin and are then dealt a number of cards with various other cities on them. They must plan a route between each of the cities in their hand of cards. On each turn they throw a die and move between the cities. The winner is the first player to visit each of their cities and then return to their home base.
